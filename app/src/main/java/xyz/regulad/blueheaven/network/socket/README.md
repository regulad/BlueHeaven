BlueHeaven implements two levels of security

* The signatures attached to each message to identify the authenticity of the message
* The "TLS" as part of the sockets to encrypt data

All key exchanges are done OOB (out of band) and are not part of the protocol.

The app will use NFC and QR codes for key exchange.
