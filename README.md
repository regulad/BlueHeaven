# ðŸ“±ðŸ“²: BlueHeaven: Bluetooth Low Energy-based mesh network for general purpose traffic

## Design Overview

BlueHeaven was born when I came into possession of around 15 Android phones and decided that I wanted to do something with them. 

Inspired by Silicon Valley's PiperNet, I quickly came up with the idea to implement a mesh network, and I wrote up my ideas here: https://regulad.notion.site/BlueHeaven-bb83b532feed4d0e9c896d2cc4130d3d?pvs=4

Based on the [B.A.T.M.A.N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N.) routing design, my nodes exchange information on the next hop to reach a destination, meaning that no single node has to know the entire network topology, which was critical as my network was going to have even bigger scalability issues than a traditional mesh network with Bluetooth devices joining and leaving reguarly.

## Implementation Woes

Although I had a lot of fun writing the code, I ran into several issues that ultimately led to me abandoning the project:

* Android's Bluetooth LE API is only available on Lolipop (5.0) and above. This means that I can't use the older phones that I have, which limited the maximum size of my network. I was left with only 5 phones to test on.
* In addition, the API requires a device to be equipped with a Bluetooth 4.2 transmitter, which isn't extremely common among old phones, even those running Lolipop. My Samsung Galaxy S5s and Moto G4 Plays were compatible, but other devices were not.
* The API also has quite bad documentation, completely omitting information on some features implemented transparently, like Hardware Address Randomization, which was a nightmare to debug.
* Android Devices can only pair to a maximum of 7 devices at a time, which means that without any masterplanning of the topology, the mesh will eventually struggle to grow as devices favor existing connections. I implemented a system to drop connections after a certain amount of time, but I hyptothesize that at scale this won't be enough.
* Occasionally, the BLE GATT server (the main method of moving data in large quanities for BLE) would refuse to start up, even between app restarts. For absolutely no good reason, restarting the device would fix this issue. I was unable to find a solution to this problem, as it only happened on my Moto G4 Plays after extended testing. It's likely a poor vendor implementation, and I suspect that I would run into additional problems as I tested on more devices.
* The client that connects to the server is extremely unreliable and often disconnects for no reason. 
* While reconnection logic was easy, BLE is restricted to creating one connection at a time per device before behaviour begins to become unpredictable.
* **Even making only one connection at a time, connection to the GATT servers was still extremely unreliable. Requests regularly shot above the 60-second timeout.**

The final problem proved to be the most fatal. Occasionally, the client would be able to connect with no problem, but completely randomly it would not be able to send data to the server. After 5+ hours of debugging, I was not able to find even a single lead towards why this was happening. Multiple devices, multiple Android versions, multiple BLE chipsets, and multiple connection methods were all tried, but the problem persisted.

## Conclusion

You can see a video of me trying out the mesh on 5 devices in my backyard, but be warned that it was 2am and I'm quite loopy: https://youtu.be/UOqSAdVVKYk

The fact that Bluetooth LE's official Mesh network spec is only intended for IoT devices should have been my first warning sign that this project was never going to work, but it was fun to try regardless. I learned a ton about Android, Jetpack Compose, BLE, and networking in general.

I'm still a little disappointed that the mesh didn't work, but I'm happy with the progress I made and the knowledge I gained. I'm excited to see what I can do with this knowledge in the future.

My next project will be a little more grounded in reality, I promise. Maybe something with `WifiManager::startLocalOnlyHotspot`? Seems like an interesting API to play with, I can already imagine marketing it to kids so they can play Minecraft together without needing a router.
